* Description: gxkb is a little indicator applet which allows one to quickly switch between different keyboard layouts in X. A flag corresponding to the country of the active layout is shown in the indicator area. The applet is written in C and uses the GTK+ library and therefore does not depend on any GNOME components.
* Depends: GTK2, libwnck22, libxklavier16
