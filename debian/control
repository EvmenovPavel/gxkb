Description: X11 keyboard indicator and switcher
 gxkb is a little indicator applet which allows one to quickly
 switch between different keyboard layouts in X. A flag
 corresponding to the country of the active layout is shown
 in the indicator area.
 .
 The applet is written in C and uses the GTK+ library and
 therefore does not depend on any GNOME components.
